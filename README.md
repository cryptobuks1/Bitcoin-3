# Bitcoin-3 BTC3
The 3rd inclination of Bitcoin


Bitcoin-3 (BTC3) is the most complete Bitcoin library for the .NET platform. It implements all most relevant Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). It also provides low level access to Bitcoin primitives so you can easily build your application on top of it.

```bash
dotnet add package Bitcoin-3
```
If using legacy .NET Framework in Visual Studio
```bash
Install-Package Bitcoin-3
```
You can also just use the `Manage NuGet Package` window on your project in Visual Studio.

The packages support:

* With full features: Windows Desktop applications, Mono Desktop applications and platforms supported by [.NET Standard 1.3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library) (.NET Core, Xamarin IOS, Xamarin Android, UWP and more).
